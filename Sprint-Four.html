          <h2 class="sub-header">Discuss how understanding the principles <br> of neuroplasticity benefits people? </h2>
        <p>Neuroplasticity is defined as the selective organizing of connections between neurons in our brains. The stronger the connections are between the neurons, the more likely you are to excel in that region.
  Understanding the principles of neuroplacity will motivate people to build the connections in their brain and increase their intelligence.

            <div class="column">
              <h2 class="sub-header">What are some of the ways to increase <br> your Neuroplaticity?</h2>
            <p>
1.Practice, practice, practice. Repeating an activity, retrieving a memory, and reviewing material in a variety of ways helps build thicker, stronger, more hard-wired connections in the brain. <br> <br>


2. Put information in context.  Or what i like to call applied learning. Which means you are learning a subject then applying it to a real life problem as soon as possible and establishing context to strengthen your understanding. </p>

                <p>3. Let students know that this is how the brain works.  Educating people on how their brains work, will shift thier perspective from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset.

                    <h2 class="sub-header">What is growth mindset and why it is relevant?</h2>
                  <p>A fixed mindset is having the idea that what you are born with, is what you have forever, Its fixed - it cannot move, it cannot change. Its like when someone says “ I wish i was as smart as him - I will never be that smart”… They believe there their Intelligence is fixed. </p>

                    <p>A growth mindset is the idea that you can grow your brain and everything can be changed. It is like when someone says “ One day i will be as smart as that person” They believe that they can grow their intelligence.
