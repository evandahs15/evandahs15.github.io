<h1> Personal Portfolio Website </h1>
This is my own personal website to showcase my work as a Developer and Designer.
Built with SASS using GULP as a workflow proccessor.<br><br>

<strong>How it Works? </strong> <br>
I am using gulp.js to deploy all my final work to the master branch where GITHUB Pages is hosting my website on a custom domain name(evandah.com). Go into the Dev branch to see the "behind-the-scenes" files that are creating this website.
