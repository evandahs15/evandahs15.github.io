              <h2 class="sub-header"> The difference between HTML,CSS and JavaScript </h2>
            <p>Think about redesigning your room. Html is the furniture inside the room. CSS is the style of the furniture, and the room and where you position it. For example what colours the room wallpaper is, and how big the furniture is. If it relates to anything with style - CSS is that.
        </p>
            </div>

              <div class="column">
                  <h2 class="secret-header"  style="color:#00043C;"> this is a secret header, no one can see</h2> <!-- H2 coloured as the background, to act as a spacer and achieve accurate alignment between paragraphs on colum 1 and 2 -->
                <p>Javascript is the interactive elements within the room. If your interact with it, then this was probably built using javascript. For example, a light switch has two functions that people interact with. On and off - the element would be considered an interactive element and will be built on javascript.
                    </p>

              <div class="column">
                <h2 class="sub-header">Control Flow and Loops </h2>
              <p>Control flow is the order or flow in which instructions are executed, just like people have have an order in which tasks are executed in their daily routine. <br>

There are different ways to change the flow of a program. <br> One way is using a ‘conditional loop’. Firstly, a loop is a piece of code that loops back over itself.  <br>

A conditional loop is a block of code that will define when the loop will continue to execute a task or stop. <br> </p>
              </div>

                <div class="column">
                    <h2 class="secret-header"  style="color:#00043C;"> this is a secret header, no one can see</h2> <!-- H2 coloured as the background, to act as a spacer and achieve accurate alignment between paragraphs on colum 1 and 2 -->
                  <p>
An analogy for this is like choosing when to put the heater on. For example if it is really cold then you would turn the heater on. This code looks like this. <br><br>

(HouseTemperature < 7DegreesCelsius) {<br>
          HeaterOn();<br>
        }<br><br>
This conditional loop will execute the code inside the {curley brackets} until the condition in the (round brackets) is no longer true. In this case once the house temperature becomes lower or equal then 7 degrees celsius the heater will turn on. Once it is above the heater will stay off.

                  <h2 class="sub-header">What the DOM is and how to use ? </h2>
                <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model, It represents the document as nodes and objects.
The DOM is the browsers way of understanding the objects inside of the HTML, CSS and Javascript and merging the pieces together to display the appropriate webpage on the display. The DOM is a hierarchical structure.  A tree diagram can be used to represent this. <br> <br>

You can actually use Javascript to change  and alter the HTML elements in the DOM. </p>

                              <h2 class="sub-header">Arrays VS Objects </h2>
                            <p>Arrays and objects are both datatypes, however they store data very differently.  In arrays, data is stored to an index number. Meaning each data item in an array will have a number attached to it depending on the position. Computers count from 0, so the first item in an array will have the number 0, then the second will have the number 1, then 2, and so on.  You can use the name of the array followed by the items index number in square brackets [ ] to fetch the value in that position of the array. eg myArray[1] . </p>

                                <p>

                      Objects are great for more complex projects, because they can store a collection of data in q lightweight manner. In objects, data is stored against a specific key.  When we create a data item inside an object we assign it to a key by creating key name proceeded with a dot(.).  Each data bit can accessed by calling up the Object and it's key e.g. objectName.keyName</p>

                                          <p>A function is exactly that, it is a piece of code built to complete a specific task or calculation.  Functions are great because they can be written once then called upon in a program to complete a task or calculation many times. You just write the formula once in the function and then input the variables into the function each time and it returns the result for that set. </p>

                                        <p>IQ is based simply from memory, mathematical patterns and logic. Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is how aware you are of your emotions and how well you can regulate and manage them mentally.  </p>

                                              <h2 class="sub-header">Why is it important?<br> </h2>
                                            <p>Emotional Intelligence is an important soft skill because it helps you connect and work with others, as the most successful projects take a great team of people to complete it. The more trained you are in EQ, the higher chance you will work better in a team and improve the success of the project.</p>
