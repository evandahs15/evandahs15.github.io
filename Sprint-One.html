          <p> This lesson you will learn about what it is like to think like a developer. Thinking in this mindset takes problem solving skills and persistence to achieve good results. We will look into this mindset using the metaphore of ultramarathon running.

      <h2 class="sub-header">Describe the process for solving problems? </h2>
    <p>The following process for thinking like a web developer reflects that running an 100 km Ultramarathon. I ran my first ultramarathon this year.
<br>
Why? When running a 100km marathon, it can look very daunting even impossible to the human mind.
<br>
The first step to completing a ultramarathon is becoming intentional. Telling your mind that this is what my goal is, and this is how i will achieve it. Once you have committed to this idea of completing your goal in your mind, the correct actions will follow.
<br>
The first action is plan ahead, figure out where you want to have breaks, how much food you will bring on the marathon, when you will eat to keep your nutrition and energy up? Once you have a plan on how to tackle the marathon it looks alot more achievable.
<br>
Then you put the plan into action and break the ultramarathon down into mini stages, focusing on 1km at a time. This helps focus your mind and energy on the small steps, instead of becoming overwhelmed by the bigger picture.
<br>
</p>
    </div>

      <div class="column">
          <h2 class="secret-header"  style="color:#00043C;"> this is a secret header, no one can see</h2> <!-- H2 coloured as the background, to act as a spacer and achieve accurate alignment between paragraphs on colum 1 and 2 -->
        <p>
          Over the course of the Ultramarathon, you will become so tired you wont want to continue. In that moment you realise your brain wants to give up, so to overcome this mental breakdown you look at other alternatives that will help you dig deep and keep going. Like Web development, if you feel stuck you look at alternatives and keep going until you solve it.
<br>
In the last 10km of the race, you have used all the tricks in the book, and you are almost there. Then you figure one last trick to keep pushing forward, this little trick is seeing your family 5km from the finish line. This motivates you to keep going like nothing else. This is similar to development, when you feel like you have pulled all the tricks out of the bag . . . keep going and you will realise that you can reach a solution like nothing else.
<br>
Once you complete the ultramarathon all you can do is think about it.You think about the entire marathon and reflect on all the highs and lows, and what you do different next time. Similar to development, when you finish solving a problem, you reflect on all the pitstops and speed-boosts that you got you to the finish and how you could improve in the next problem to come.

      <div class="column">
        <h2 class="sub-header">How will you integrate this idea? </h2>
      <p>I have learnt is that planning, persistence, and reflection are important to solving problems. Breaking the problem down into mini stages really helps you understand the problem in-depth and find the best possible route to solve it. Becoming clear on the problem is one of the most important things to do when tackling a problem. Not only will this give you a clear idea of whats ahead, this will help you see potential pitfalls and possible solutions before you start.

          <p>
          Then when times get hard, keep persisting and realise that you will find a way, you just need to try coming at a different angle when approaching the problem and maybe you will find a solution. Then when you are finished, reflect on the process and understand how you could improve in the future. Also having a framework is important, this framework will help guide you throughout the problem solving process and help you when times get hard.

          <h2 class="sub-header">What did you learn about flipped classroom? </h2>
        <p>Flipped learning is a more engaging way to learn in the classroom. It involves the students learning the basics outside of class to then into class with an understanding of the subject ready to have more in-depth conversations with the teacher to gain a better understanding.
        </p>
        </div>

            <p>
              The teacher can then spend less time giving lectures, and more time one on one with students. This approach enables teachers to give more personalised sessions with students so they can gain a better understanding. It also enables students to have more control over their learning, and learn in a way that better suits them.

      <div class="column">
        <h2 class="sub-header"> Whats the difference between git and GitHub? </h2>
      <p>
        Firstly we need to understand what  version control is. Version control allows you to work on files in folders, without your changes overriding other peoples work. The version control will tell you if your going to override someones work. <br>
Git is a system for version control, it runs with the command line on your local machine, and it allows you to keep track on your files and folders and any changes that have happened in the repository.

</p>
      </div>

        <div class="column">
          <h2 class="secret-header"  style="color:#00043C;"> this is a secret header, no one can see</h2> <!-- H2 coloured as the background, to act as a spacer and achieve accurate alignment between paragraphs on colum 1 and 2 -->
          <p>
            Git essentially does this by creating “timestamps” on the files you are working on for each person who is working on it. This makes it easy to reverse in time and see what you were working on, or what one of your time mates were working on.<br>
  Github is a website where you can upload your git repository online. You should do this to backup your files,  It gives you a visual interface to navigate to your folders. It gives other people a way to navigate your repos, it makes repo collaboration easy.
    </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <div class="column">
          <h2 class="sub-header"> What is an analogy for Github and Git? </h2>
        <p>
          Traditionally, to prevent users from overwriting each-other work they would create many versions and share them. This can get very confusing later down the track when there are many files in folders.  Instead of creating many versions, Git creates  “timestamps “ each time someone in the team has made a change.
  </p>
        </div>

          <div class="column">
            <h2 class="secret-header"  style="color:#00043C;"> this is a secret header, no one can see</h2> <!-- H2 coloured as the background, to act as a spacer and achieve accurate alignment between paragraphs on colum 1 and 2 -->
            <p>
            A person can then click on the time stamp and reverse or fast forward the project to see that persons changes. Github does the exact same thing, but on steroids.  Github is an online website that has a graphical interface so its easy to navigate, and it has a very large amount of storage for you to share and upload your Git repositories.</p>

Git hub flow is creating a branch when working on a feature or an issue, then making changes and making a pull request to review you changes, then pushing your changes to be approved to merge the branch with the master.  </p>

      1. Create a directory and use git init to make it a git repo. <br>
      2. Then check the status for a quick update. <br>
      3. Add files into the repo <br>
      4. Track these files with git by placing them into the staging index with git add <br>
      5. Commit these files files into the working directory, by entering git commit. <br>
<br>
      It will then open your code editor where you can do your first commit which is usually “initial commit” now your files are being tracked by git. For every change you do to each file, you should be committing them to git.

        First you get all your coding files and get them ready to write details on them… so there all ready, now you start writing the details on them like the date, the delivery person, and the address… lastly you push the stamp down as the final step to complete that certain piece of mail.
This is similar to committing your files using commit, you write down the details about what changes you have made to that file, and then save i

                        Whenever you create a new repository, it will become the master. Later on you will start branching off the master to fix issues, create new features and so on.
                          The master is expected to have the most perfect code, this is the repository that is closest to the finish product.  </p>

                            We create branches when we want to fix issues, or create new features without effecting the master. Once we have fixed the issue, we can the ask the owner of the master to review the fix and approve merging it with the master.

                                <p>
          1. First you must fork the original repository <br>
2. Go into settings and make sure the issues box is checked<br>
3. Clone the repository, do this by copying the link and going to iterminal and pressing "git clone (Url of repository)" <br>
4. make sure you have prepared a directory for this clone, and are in the correct directory in iterminal when making the clone.<br>
5. Go in and make any changes to the files that you like.<br>
6. Go back to iterminal<br>
7. Check the git status<br>
8. Add the changes to the stageing index by going git add (filename)<br>
9. Commit the changes by going git commit -m<br>
10. Push the changes by going git push origin master<br>
11. Your changes should be in.<br>

                                      Forking follows the same structure as branching, it is good to fork when you want to make a new feature, or fix an issue without effecting the main repository. However, forking enables you  to make a copy of your repository so when you push changes. you do not need to wait for an owner to approve your changes, as you are the owner. The owner of the main repository can then view your repository and decide whether or not they would like to merge.
  This workflow enables large organic teams to work effecively and safely without making overrides.  This stream of collaboration is also known as the github flow. It allow changes to be made in a fast, but safe enviroment.

      <h2 class="sub-header"> What is the difference between cloning from a forked and cloning from a non-forked repo? </h2>
    <p>A fork replicates the existing repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
When you clone from a forked, all changes that you decide to push later on will effect your copy. This means that if you make any mistakes . . . its ok because your using a copy of repo.

        <p>
If you have cloned a non-forked repo, every change you commit and push will effect the original copy. This makes it very risky for if you make mistakes to the original copy there is no going back.

        <h2 class="sub-header"> What is a analogy to describe forking? </h2>
      <p>Forking is like branching, instead of editing the original... you can branch off and edit in a safe enviroment, then submit a pull request ready for the owner to look at. if they like it they might push and approve your changes then merge it into the original.

              <h2 class="secret-header"> What is a remote?</h2> <!-- H2 coloured as the background, to act as a spacer and achieve accurate alignment between paragraphs on colum 1 and 2 -->
          <p>
            Remote repositories are only thought as a means for sharing and exchanging code between developers - not for actually working on files.

            Local repositories reside on the computers of team members. In contrast, remote repositories are hosted on a server that is accessible for all team members - most likely on the internet or on a local network.
            A remote repository doesn't have such a working directory: it only consists of the bare ".git" repository folder.

            <h2 class="sub-header"> How are they set up?</h2>
          <p>So you have a remote repo, which will be on github. To create this remote repo just go to github and create a new repo.
Then you must clone it and make a local copy using iterminal. Then you must fetch the information, by first making an upstream copy or by making a seperate remote.

              <p>
                This will mean that every time you fetch information it will create a seperate branch from the working directory. Then when you are happy with any of the changes, you can merge the branch you have fetched from the remote with your local master. Then you can push it back up to git hub.

            <p>My strategy was to study every night for four hours, when I was available that is. But i found that it took alot longer, because there were many times i would get confused because of the instructions. I would then google the errors that i was getting, then follow googles advice, and most the time that wouldnt work.<p>

                <p>
              So i would go back and read the instructions again from dev academy and just trail and error until i get it. These little errors took up alot of time, but once i got it. Yeah it was good.

                          These aree my core values. In 2017 I was working as an Event Manager for Corporate Challenge NZ.  I had very good relationsips with my boss, and my coeagues. I loved my job. I loved that each day had new opportunities to grow and I was able to learn from the people I met. However, It was very administrative and I felt like my other core values were not being met. In particular, my Innovative side.

                              It was a very hard decision to leave a well paying job that I loved, but It felt like the right decision to make. I left this job to chase my dream job as a UX designer. I feel like this career fulfils all of my values equally. I joined Unitec to finish my last year of my Bachelor of Creative Enterprises, which i graduate from in November 2018. I then intend to finish Dev Academey to then go on and gain a UX designer role.

              This year I joined the annual Datacom Hackathon as a UI/ UX designer. I was working with a team member to write the script for the final presentation.

                              I said fair enough, lets do it. I went back and incorporated her idea. That wasnt good enough for her, she wanted me to add more of her ideas and tell me how to say it. I then took charge and told her that I am presenting and I need to feel comfortable delivering this pitch. She then backed off and the presentation for that pitch went very smoothly.
