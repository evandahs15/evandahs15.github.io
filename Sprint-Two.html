          <p> This lesson you will learn about how items on your websites are displayed using the display setting.
          We will cover how the display settings work and the most common
          display settings - block, inline and inline-block.

    <div class="column">
      <h2 class="sub-header">What is display?</h2>
      <p>Display is a term used in css to determine how they content will be displayed, as there are many ways to display an item.  For example if we have an item and we don’t want it to be visible we can use the css code: Display: None;
        lets say for some reason we want to display the item inside a table like grid, we could use the code: Display: Table
        <br>
        By default all items use display: block;
        This means that each block element will start on a new line and take up all the available width inside its parent element. For example with  block elements you can choose the width, but by default it will push the next element down.
      </p>
    </div>

      <div class="column">
          <h2 class="secret-header"  style="color:#00043C;"> this is a secret header, no one can see</h2> <!-- H2 coloured as the background, to act as a spacer and achieve accurate alignment between paragraphs on colum 1 and 2 -->
        <p> So there are many different options on how to display an item using the code display. This blog explores two of the most commonly used display options:
        <br>
        Display: Inline  and Display: Inline-block;.

  <section>
      <div class="column">
        <h2 class="sub-header">What is Display:  Inline ?</h2>
        <p>Inline is just that. It’s on the same line.<br>
Its the default setting for a text span or a text link.
Inline content ignores any values you’ve entered for dimensions eg. Making the width 300px will be ignored if displayed inline. Instead, It can only be changed using text settings like font size and font weight.
This video is the perfect example showing elements on the same line being adjusted by text settings. Display:inline is great for hyper links or text styling within a paragraph.

        <div class="column">
          <h2 class="sub-header">What is Display:  Inline - block ?</h2>
          <p>Inline block is as wide as the content inside, inline elements flow on the same line and wrap to the next line when it hits the boundary of the parent item. With inline block elements you can adjust the size of the item by changing the width and so on. Aswell as this Inline elements react to the text alignment of the parent elements.
            This video shows elements being added to the same line, until they reach the boundary and move to the line below. Display: inline - block is good for wrapping multiple images in a container.

                <p>
                  I will stay committed to the course and help those around me. It is imperative for my own learning to stay involved with the group, stay up-to date with the course, listen and cooperate with the facilitators and any advice they provide me. I will stay determined to the very end. When times are hard i will communicate with the facilitators and find a solution around this.

                    <p>
                      As well as this i will prepare prior to every sprint to make sure i am ready to be active and engage in the learning material.  I will commit to 5 days a week, from 8am to 5pm and Wednesday to Friday.
        I will stay committed to using slack, and engaging in conversations when others need help. I will use slack to get over obstacles that are too hard.
